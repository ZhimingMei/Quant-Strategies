## Momentum Strategy

### Digest Summary
**Momentum strategies** exploit a tendency for a stock's prior returns and prior news about its earnings to predict future returns. The authors confirm momentum for subsequent six-month and one-year periods. Prior returns and prior earnings contribute to predicted future returns after controlling for the other.

### Idea
In a certain period of time, if a stock or a stock portfolio performed well (poorly) in the previous period, the stock or stock portfolio will still perform well (poorly) in the next period.

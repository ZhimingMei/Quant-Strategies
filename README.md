# Quant-Strategies

Here I create several folders to store the quant strategies. Specifically, the *Classic Strategy* folder is used to store some famous strategies, like momentum, MACD, etc. And for other folders, they may be some factors, or some ideas, that are inspired by research reports, news, etc.

I will continue to update this repository. And currently, we have following strategies (factors).

## Content
